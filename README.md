netchan
==========

This is a sloppy implementation of go's [new proposed netchan interface](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/Er3TetntSmg/YExbTtIH9jYJ). Please don't take it seriously.

TODO
----

1) Make it work...

2) Sort out what happens when things fail, when connections are closed, when unpublishing.

3) Reuse connections.
